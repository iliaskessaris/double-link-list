This program aims to define a node for use in a Double Link Lists and 
then to provide the essential function to manage it (add node, delete node, 
print the list forward and reverse order, store the list to file, build list
from file). The node, in our case, can store only an integer as data. 
We can easyly modify the node, and  consequently the whole program, 
to manage double link lists with varius data types.
